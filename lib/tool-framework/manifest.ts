/**
 * The application-side tool manifest.
 *
 * `packages/tool-catalog` is pure logic and holds no inventory, so somebody has
 * to answer "which tools exist?" for it. That is this module, and it obeys the
 * same invariant `catalog.ts` does:
 *
 *   ENUMERATION COMES FROM THE DATABASE, NEVER FROM THE BUNDLE.
 *
 * There is no generated registry, no `import.meta.glob`, no array of tools.
 * `managed_tools` is the only list. One entry per stored row, always — that is
 * what makes a row written by the admin "New tool" form manageable before its
 * folder is deployed, and what keeps the seven Paperwork tools (which predate
 * `tools/` and have no folder) in the manifest without hard-coding them.
 *
 * A row's *code* is then loaded by folder name via a dynamic import, which is a
 * lookup, not an enumeration: nothing here can tell you what folders exist,
 * only fetch one you already named. That lookup is also the only honest test of
 * whether a row's code has shipped, and it supplies the grouping label and
 * keywords the shipped definition owns.
